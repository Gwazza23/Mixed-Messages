# Mixed Messages Codecademy Project

## Description
This project was built as part of the portofolio project for Codecademy, the task
was to build a javascript that would return a random message. Throughout building this 
project I got to reinforce the coding language I had learnt previously, especially troubleshooting
errors and dealing with faulty code.The main purpose of this code is to return a message, either a
motivational one or a joke.


## Features
This project uses the built in Math object in order to generate random numbers.
Then a function is make sure that the random number generated previously is either 0 or 1,
from here depending if the number , either a joke or a motivational speech is returned from
already built array.

## How to use
To use this script just run script and the terminal will display a different message each run.
